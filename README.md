# Idea 
The LiveSafe project gives users a one-stop shop for quantifying the risks of natural disasters for a particular zip code in the US. It displays several layers of data, including different kinds of disasters and different timeframes (present, predictions, etc.)

A user can interact with the data in two ways: maps and comparisons.  The user can look at a map with as many layers as needed, or go into a detailed comparison of two different places with all the in-depth information about those places at once. 

The data will be granular at the zip code level.  The API allows a user to specify an address and directs them to the right zipcode.


## Mission statement: 
To bring together relevant information about disaster risks in a particular area, to inform the buying and renting decisions of potential homeowners.

### Why build this?
What problem does this application solve?  
To give people a single, interactive map for visualizing the natural disasters that could affect their real estate choices.  Plenty of real estate websites have details about crime and home values, but data about natural disasters is only available in government databases.  We will make it accessible and visual.

### How does your application solve the problem?  
We solve the problem by giving the user an interactive map of the whole US with details about risks in colorful layers (colormaps) that they can turn on and off.  This includes currently known risks (based on historical data) as well as projections for the future (details TBD). The user can also do deeper, tabular comparisons between a handful of places that they select.
