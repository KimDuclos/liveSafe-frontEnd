# Landing Page

Designed in Figma. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY EARLY DRAFT!

This is the link to the open design file, anyone can edit it. I encourage everyone to play around with their ideas of how we want the landing page to look and submit new photo updated screen shots of their work on to this markdown file.
